# Aviation Accident Analysis

# Overview

Analysis of NTSB aviation accident data to provide safety-focused aircraft acquisition recommendations
for a client entering the aviation industry. Aircraft are evaluated on serious/fatal injury rates and
destruction rates, split into small (≤20 passengers) and large (>20 passengers) categories.

# Key Findings

Large Aircraft (>20 passengers)
Boeing dominates; the 777, 757, and 787 post near-zero injury rates.
Bombardier CL-600-2B19 and Embraer EMB145 are strong alternatives.

Small Aircraft (≤20 passengers)
Cessna leads with 6 of the top 10 safest models. CESSNA 170, CESSNA 180,
and PIPER PA-18 are the top recommendations, with any CESSNA 172 variant also reliable.

# Other Factors

Weather: IMC accidents show ~3x higher injury rates than VMC, avoid poor visibility operations.
Engines: More engines does not reliably correlate with greater safety
